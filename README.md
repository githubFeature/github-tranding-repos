# Trending Github Repositories using ReactJS + SASS 

Learning React for a couple of days, I created this application just for experience. The app finds GitHub Repositories by some keywords and shows them to the user sorting by stars. 

## Using
### `npm start` or `yarn start` 

Runs the app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. <br>
The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.<br>
You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.

### `npm test` or `yarn test` 

Runs the test watcher in an interactive mode.<br>
By default, runs tests related to files changed since the last commit.

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
By default, it also [includes a service worker](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#making-a-progressive-web-app) so that your app loads from local cache on future visits.
